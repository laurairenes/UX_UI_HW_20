          <p>During testing we found that cards were too transparent and hard to read. We had to play with background blurring and opacity to make things readable while staying within our soft and soothing design.  
        </p>
          <p class="mb-0">Features were clunky when adding tags for “Add New Goal” feature. Field obscured by keyboard. The User Quiz check boxes too small, increase size to avoid missing intended field. The “Journal updated” overlay is too transparent, not readable, so we increased opacity.</p>
